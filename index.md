Hi! My name is Boris. I'm a machine learning and big data
professional with 15+ years of experience. Please see my
[CV](boris-shminke.pdf) or find me at
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/inpefess/).

My current projects include GenAI [training
assistant](https://expleo.com/global/en/case-studies/gen-ai-training-coach/),
hierarchical data extraction from free text using LLMs, and code
generation for ecological modelling.

I contribute code to open source software, including my tiny projects
(collection of [RL
environments](https://github.com/inpefess/gym-saturation) and a
Python [client](https://github.com/inpefess/isabelle-client) to a
proof assistant) as well as large and famous ones ([Apache
Spark](https://github.com/apache/spark/pull/20691) and
[Ray](https://github.com/ray-project/ray/pull/34790)).

I defended a PhD [thesis](https://theses.fr/2023COAZ4058) and
published
[papers](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=AxWTLt0AAAAJ) in
AI for automated theorem proving.
